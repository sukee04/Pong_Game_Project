# Pong_Game_Project
ðŸŽ® Pong Game using Python Turtle â€“ Project Summary

This project involves creating a simple Pong game using Python's built-in Turtle graphics module. The game simulates the classic arcade table tennis game where two players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle and to score points when the opponent misses.

Key Features:

1. Two-player mode with keyboard controls.
2. Real-time ball movement and collision detection with paddles and walls.
3. Score tracking and display.
4. Simple GUI using Turtle for game elements (paddles, ball, scoreboard).

Technologies Used:

1. Python 3
2. Turtle Graphics (for GUI and animations)

Learning Outcomes:

1. Understanding of basic game loops and collision logic.
2. Hands-on experience with GUI design using Turtle.
3. Use of functions, event handling, and object movement in Python.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to learn Python programming through game development in a fun and interactive way.
